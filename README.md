# MIT 18.065 Problem Set Solutions
My solutions for MIT 18.065 S18 Problem Sets (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/). Uploading here just for my records. Please don't follow if enrolled in the course. Use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/DeepOde/mit18.065-pset-soln/tree/main/) 
incase jupyter notebooks don't load properly. 

I plan to upload a solution for one lecture a day :).
Current status : 1/35.
